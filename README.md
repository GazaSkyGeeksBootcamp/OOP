# OOP

 (Student System)
1. Create a Student constructor function with the following properties:
    - name
    - age
    - grade
    - introduce() method that logs a message like:


"Hi, my name is Ali, I’m 20 years old, and I’m in grade A."Notice that Ali, 20 and A are coming from the properties name, age and grade of the constructor function.
2. Make grade property private and can be accessed using getGrade() and set its value using setGrade() , the grade should be only A or F (you should validate it)
